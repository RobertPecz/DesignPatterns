#Solid principles

S = Single responsibilty principle. A class should do only one thing.

O = Open close principle. Open for extension close for modification. Useage and importance of interfaces.

L = Liskov substitution principle. When the child class overwrite something in the parent class it shouldn't break the code.

I = Interface segregation principle. When an interface implemented the class should use all of the interface members and methods. If not the interface should separate.
